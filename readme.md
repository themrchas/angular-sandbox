# Assignment #7



### Overview of Submission ###
```
This application performs all CRUD operations using Angular.  The server supporting this assignment is essentially the same code used for Assignment 5, but with a route put in app.js to support the Angular front end.

The Angular client uses many of the concepts demonstrated in the weekly lectures.

### Submission Details ###

Splash page: http://165.227.144.128:8080/

With respect to CRUD, the UI is hopefully easy to navigate and 'self' explanatory.
